Sometimes they were a bit picky about angles and timing (waiting for perfect light), but I guess that's what makes the difference. Would definitely recommend for high-end projects.",

The way they captured the lighting and our traditional mashrabiya screens was perfect. Took a bit longer than expected for editing (maybe 2 weeks?) but worth it. Already getting so many compliments on our Instagram from the photos!",

Nashray team handled it really well - they were flexible with scheduling around tenant availability which was a big help. Photos came out sharp and professional, perfect for our investor presentations. One small thing, wish the initial quote included the drone shots separately so we knew the total cost upfront, but overall very satisfied with their work.",
